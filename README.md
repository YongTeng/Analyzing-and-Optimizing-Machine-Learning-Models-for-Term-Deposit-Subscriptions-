<p align="justify"> The scope of this problem encompasses several dimensions. Firstly, it involves analyzing client data, including age, job type, marital status, education level, credit default status, housing loan status, personal loan status, and balance. These factors provide insights into the client's financial stability, lifestyle, and potential willingness to invest in a term deposit. Additionally, the problem involves considering the details of the last contact made during the current campaign, such as the communication type, month, day, and duration of the contact. These factors may influence the client's receptiveness to the term deposit offer and their likelihood of subscribing .

Furthermore, the problem extends to building a predictive model that can effectively utilize the available data to forecast whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. This requires employing machine learning algorithms to train the model on historical data, validate its performance, and ultimately make predictions on new data. The predictive model must be robust enough to handle the categorical and numeric features present in the dataset and should be able to generalize well to unseen data to provide reliable predictions for future marketing campaigns.

Moreover, the problem involves evaluating the effectiveness of the predictive model and potentially refining it to improve its accuracy and performance. This may entail fine-tuning the model parameters, feature engineering, and conducting thorough analyses of model predictions to identify areas for improvement. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can assist the bank in targeting its marketing efforts more efficiently and achieving higher subscription rates for term deposits, thereby enhancing its overall profitability and customer satisfaction.

<p align="justify"> The process starts with Business Understanding, where the goals and requirements of the bank's campaign are defined. This step is critical to frame the analysis and model development. Next, Data Preparation involves cleaning and structuring the data collected from Kaggle. This data is then subjected to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where insights and patterns are discovered through visual and statistical methods to understand the factors influencing a customer's decision to open a term deposit. Following EDA, the Modelling phase uses the insights gained to develop predictive models that can forecast the likelihood of customers opening term deposits based on their profiles and past behavior. Next, Model training in Artificial Intelligence involves training data for machine learning algorithm. Finally, the performance of these models is then Evaluated using various metrics to ensure their accuracy and relevance.

# Exploration Data Analysis (EDA)
## Diagram 1: Information on Term Subscription.

<img width="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8e4cc70-93cd-4481-9f21-8a6e8aba0085">

<p align="justify"> The visuals provided present a clear depiction of the outcomes of a bank's marketing campaign for term deposits, segmented by customer responses and education levels. From the pie chart, we gather a near-even split in the campaign's outcomes, with 47.38% of clients opting to open term deposits and 52.62% deciding against it. This balanced outcome suggests that while the campaign reached a responsive audience, there is significant room for optimization. The data implies that almost half of the target demographic is inclined to consider the product, indicating a solid foundation on which to build future marketing strategies. To enhance these outcomes, the bank must delve deeper into understanding the characteristics and motivations of the segment that declined the offer and tailor its approach to address their reservations.

The bar graph indicated a strong correlation between education levels and the likelihood of opening a term deposit. Individuals with tertiary education represent the highest percentage of positive responses, followed by those with secondary education. This trend suggests that higher education levels may correspond with a greater propensity to invest in term deposits, possibly due to better financial literacy or a more substantial income, allowing for such investments. On the contrary, the primary education group, and notably the 'unknown' category, show markedly less engagement. This information is invaluable for directing marketing efforts, indicating that campaigns should be more heavily focused on the more responsive, educated demographics, or conversely, that there is a need to make term deposit investments more accessible or attractive to less educated sectors.

## Diagram 2: Distribution of ages By Occupation.

<img width="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53dea8f1-1319-423c-8971-1fb1942f1669">

<p align="justify"> The boxplot presented the distribution of ages by occupation appears to be part of a dataset analysis related to a bank marketing campaign focusing on opening term deposits. Occupations such as management and technicians show a wide age range with median ages suggesting a mature workforce, possibly with more disposable income and a potential interest in financial products like term deposits. Retired individuals are represented with a high median age (67), as expected, and the presence of younger retirees as outliers indicates diversity within this group.

The services and blue-collar job categories display a broad distribution of ages but tend to skew younger (min 20,22), which might indicate these individuals are at different life stages with varying financial priorities compared to those in management. Understanding the age spread within occupations can guide the bank in customizing its communication and offerings; for instance, younger individuals may be more responsive to digital marketing campaigns and long-term growth opportunities, while older clients might prioritize the stability and security that term deposits offer.

The entrepreneur, self-employed, and student categories show notable age diversity, with students clustered at the lower end of the age spectrum. This presents an opportunity for the bank to engage with young customers early in their financial journey, perhaps offering term deposits as a starter savings product. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs and the self-employed exhibit a range of ages but with a concentration in the mid-life area, where financial planning becomes crucial. Tailoring marketing strategies to each of these distinct occupational demographics by age can potentially increase the uptake of term deposits across the board.

## Diagram 3: The Impact of Duration in Opening a Term Deposit.

<img width="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed6230b4-74df-4e82-ae3f-95db091b7322">

<p align="justify"> The bar chart illustrated the correlation between the duration of contact with customers and the success of opening a term deposit, indicated by the two bars labelled 'above average' and 'below average' for the duration of customer interactions. The 'above average' duration corresponds with a higher percentage of successful term deposit openings, while a 'below average' duration shows a lower success rate. This suggests that longer conversations with clients may be more effective at convincing them to open a term deposit, possibly due to a more thorough explanation of the benefits or overcoming objections during the course of the interaction.

From this data, it's reasonable to infer that the bank's marketing team could increase the effectiveness of their campaign by allocating more time to each customer interaction, ensuring that potential clients have all the information they need to make an informed decision. The significant difference in success rates between the two duration categories underscores the importance of engagement quality over quantity. Training bank representatives to conduct more detailed discussions and to better address customer queries could lead to higher conversion rates for term deposits. It also highlights the potential value of pre-call planning to identify customer needs and tailor the conversation accordingly, thus maximizing the impact of each call.

<p align="justify"> Diagram 7 illustrates a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, which offers insights into the diagnostic ability of binary classifier systems: Gradient Boosting, Neural Net, and Naïve Bayes, as their discrimination threshold varies. The curve plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at different threshold settings. The TPR, also known as sensitivity or recall, measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified, while the FPR quantifies the proportion of actual negatives incorrectly classified as positives. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) serves as the crucial metric, with higher score indicating better discriminatory ability (Janssens & Martens, 2020). In this scenario, the Gradient Boosting and Neural Net demonstrate strong performance, achieving high AUC scores of 91.75% and 91.54%, respectively. Conversely, the Naïve Bayes Classifier lags behind with a lower AUC score of 80.28%. Notably, all classifiers surpass the minimum ROC score of 50%, indicating performance superior to random guessing. The ROC curve facilitates comparison of classifier performance and aids in selecting the optimal operating point based on specific application requirements.
